* When building the userspace programs (in user/) by gcc-4.4, gcc-4.4 puts the PLT segments below 0x4000_0000, even though the option "-Ttext=0x40000000e" is present (in user/Makefile.inc). This will cause parts of the userspace program are loaded in the kernel space (below 0x40000000).

  WORKAROUND: use newer version gcc, such as gcc-4.6. Newer version gcc does not generate the PLT segments.
