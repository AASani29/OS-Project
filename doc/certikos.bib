		 unduly limiting the structure of applications. HiStar's
		 security features make it possible to implement a
		 Unix-like environment with acceptable performance
		 almost entirely in an untrusted user-level library. The
		 system has no notion of superuser and no fully trusted
		 code other than the kernel. HiStar's features permit
		 several novel applications, including an entirely
		 untrusted login process, separation of data between
		 virtual private networks, and privacypreserving,
		 untrusted virus scanners.",
