Installation Guide

There are three different ways to setup CertiKOS on disk/disk images.

1 Grub2 + CertiKOS
This is the recommended way to setup CertiKOS.

1.1 Prerequisite
Grub2, dd (only needed when installing CertiKOS on real disks)

1.2 Installation
(1) Change current work directory to the root directory of CertiKOS, and type following command

      make iso

    . This command creates a disk image file certikos.img in directory obj/. It can be used in
    QEMU and BOCHS.

(2) (optional) Suppose the disk device where you want to install CertiKOS is /dev/sdb. Type following command to install the disk image to the disk

      dd if=obj/certikos.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4096

    . (NOTE: this command will break original data (MBR, partition table, file system, etc.) on the disk.) Set this disk as the first boot device and then start to play with CertiKOS.
